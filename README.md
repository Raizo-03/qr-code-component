## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Custom Properties (HSL)
- Google Fonts (Outfit)


### What I learned

ðŸ¤” What I Learned
This was my first Frontend Mentor project. Hereâ€™s what I took away:

How to structure a semantic HTML layout using <main> and <footer>.

How to use CSS variables to maintain consistent theming.

How to apply Google Fonts (Outfit) via @import or <link>.

Importance of avoiding fixed heights and using responsive units (max-width, min-height, auto) for better mobile support.

Centering content vertically using flexbox:

```html
body {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```


### Continued development
For future projects, I want to:
  - Practice building layouts using CSS Grid.
  - Learn to implement accessibility best practices (e.g., proper alt text, landmarks).
  - Improve responsive techniques using media queries.



### Useful resources

- Google Fonts - Outfit â€“ For clean, modern typography.
- CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox â€“ Helped me understand vertical centering.
